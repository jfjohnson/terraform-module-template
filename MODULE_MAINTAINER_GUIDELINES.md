# Creating a new GitHub repository
## When to write a module 
* In principle any combination of resources and other constructs can be factored out into a module, but over-using modules can make your overall Terraform configuration harder to understand and maintain, so we recommend moderation.
* A good module should raise the level of abstraction by describing a new concept in your architecture that is constructed from resource types offered by providers.
* A new repo should be requested for each module as iPipeline is taking a polyrepo approach to our Terraform modules.  It may make sense to have a limited number of submodules in the repo as long as [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is enforced.
* It is not recommend to write modules that are just thin wrappers around single other resource types. If you have trouble finding a name for your module that isn't the same as the main resource type inside it, that may be a sign that your module is not creating any new abstraction and so the module is adding unnecessary complexity. Just use the resource type directly in the calling module instead.
## How to request a new GitHub repository for your module
* An email should be sent to git-admins@ipipeline.com with the following information to request a new GitHub repo for a Terraform module:
  * Name of the repo following the terraform-\<PROVIDER\>-\<NAME\> [standard](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/registry/publish.html). Examples: terraform-google-vault or terraform-aws-ec2-instance
  * Based on the terraform-module-template **(TODO: make hyperlink)**
  * List of GitHub Member usernames who should be granted the [Admin role](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) in the repo.
  

# Customizing your newly provisioned GitHub repository
* You should add a short description explaining the functionality of the Terraform module(s) in your repository to the repository description.
* **(label your repo..aka Topics... @Wayne-Ennis ...CCOE-923)**
* The .github/CODEOWNERS file in the template grants permissions to the code owners in the template repository. You should modify the [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS) in your repository with your code owners.


# Standard Module Structure
The [standard module structure](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html#standard-module-structure) is a file and directory layout we recommend for reusable modules distributed in separate repositories. Terraform tooling is built to understand the standard module structure and use that structure to generate documentation, index modules for the module registry, and more.

# Contributing & Approving Changes
* All contributions should follow the guidelines explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Creating a Release
* Modules should always be pinned to a [specific version](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html#selecting-a-revision-1) so it is important that tags are created to publish versions.
* The best way to create a version tag is by creating a [release](/release), but you can just create a tag directly.
* Most importantly, the tag must follow the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) pattern of vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (i.e. v1.2.23) where:
  * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
  * PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.  
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

# Quality of Code
* It is important to think of your module as a product you are delivering to the rest of the organization and therefore they are dependent on stable, quality, reliable releases.
* The repository template has included some rudimentary quality checks that automatically run on pull requests to help inform the approving reviewers of the quality of the code being contributed.
  * [Terraform Format](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/fmt.html) - checks that the Terraform configuration files conform to a canonical format and style.
  * [Terraform Init](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/init.html) - initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files which ensures that all references to 3rd party components are valid (i.e. child modules, plugins, etc.).
  * [Terraform Validate](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/validate.html) - runs checks that verify whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent, regardless of any provided variables or existing state. It is thus primarily useful for general verification of reusable modules, including correctness of attribute names and value types.
  * [Checkov Security Analysis](https://www.checkov.io/) - scans cloud infrastructure managed in Terraform and detects *some*  misconfigurations.
* As your modules mature, gain wider adoption & potentially get more complex, it is important to also expand the depth & breadth of your testing suite.  Here are some tools to consider (in no particular order):
  * [terraform-compliance](https://terraform-compliance.com/)
  * [Terraform Plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html)
  * [terratest](https://terratest.gruntwork.io/)
  * [Regula](https://github.com/fugue/regula)
  * [tfsec](https://github.com/liamg/tfsec)
  * [terrascan](https://github.com/cesar-rodriguez/terrascan)
  * [terraform-aws-secure-baseline](https://github.com/nozaq/terraform-aws-secure-baseline)

# Roles & Permissions
### Contributors
These users are assigned the *Write* role in order to push to your project, although the master branch is protected from contributors.  The terraform-contributors team members will have *write* role to encourage contribution to the repository.
### Code Owners
These users are also assigned the *Write* role in order to push to your project, but they are also listed in the CODEOWNERS file in order to approve pull requests and push to the master branch.  There should be at least 2 code owners assigned per repository.
### Maintainers
Users assigned the *Admin* role will have full access to the project.  This role should be limited to a select few individuals. Organizational and Account admins would also have repository admin role priveleges if they were required so it may not be required for every repository to have admins explicitly assigned.

See [Repository permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) for more detailed information on permission levels.
